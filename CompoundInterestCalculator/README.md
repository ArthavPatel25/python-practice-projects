# Compound Interest Calculator

## Overview
The Compound Interest Calculator is a simple Python program that helps simulate investment growth by:
- **Calculating Compound Interest** over a specified period
- **Displaying Yearly Growth** in a visually interpretable format

This project demonstrates basic modularity in Python by organizing the code into functions, making it easier to follow and extend.

## How to Use
1. Run the `compound_interest_calculator.py` script in Python.
2. Enter the following details when prompted:
   - Initial investment amount
   - Annual interest rate (e.g., 0.05 for 5%)
   - Number of years for investment
   - Number of times interest compounds per year
3. The program will display the investmentâ€™s yearly growth in dollar amounts along with a simple text-based bar graph.

## Example Usage
```plaintext
Welcome to the Compound Interest Calculator!
Enter the initial investment amount: 1000
Enter the annual interest rate (as a decimal, e.g., 0.05 for 5%): 0.05
Enter the number of years: 5
Enter the number of times interest is compounded per year: 4

Yearly Growth of Investment:
Year 1: $1050.95 ==========
Year 2: $1104.94 ============
Year 3: $1161.98 =============
Year 4: $1222.14 ==============
Year 5: $1285.49 ===============
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Running the Program
To run the program:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where `compound_interest_calculator.py` is located.
3. Run the script with the following command:
